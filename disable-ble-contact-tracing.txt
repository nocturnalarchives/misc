Contact Tracing is being done using BLE, turning off your normal Bluetooth connectivity does not prevent you from being tracked using BLE.

Here are the steps on how to disable BLE on an iPhone or Android Phone

IPHONE
Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Share My Location > Find My iPhone

Enable Offline Finding: Turn Off

Send Last Location: Turn Off

WARNING
Making these changes will break most of the “Find My iPhone” functionality.


ANDROID

Google App > Tap profile icon > Manage your Google Account > Data & Personalization > Under Activity Controls - Pause Location History.
Also,
Settings > Google Services & Preferences > Security > Find My Device - Off

WARNING
These changes will break the “Find My Device” functionality.
